OOPS Concepts
Inheritance
The property of acquiring all the properties and behaviors of the parent object by an object is termed as inheritance. This is a unique feature in object oriented programming languages which facilitates re-usability of the code of the parent class by the derived class. In JavaScript, extends keyword is used to serve the purpose of inheritance.

Unlike old-school constructor functions where the new operator does the initialization of this to a newly-allocated object, this isn't automatically initialized for a class defined by the extends keyword, i.e the sub-classes.

Therefore running the above code will give an error:

Uncaught ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor


class Car{

   constructor(n,b){

      this.name=n
      this.brand=b
   }

   showDetails(){
      console.log(`${this.name} ${this.brand}`)
   }
}
var car1 = new SUV('Duster','Renault')


Step 1. 

class SUV extends Car{

  

}


Step 2.


class SUV extends Car{

   constructor(x,y)
 {
    super(x,y)
    
 }
}




Step 3.


class SUV extends Car{

   constructor(x,y)
 {
    super()
    this.myCar=x
    this.myBrand=y
 }
}



Step 4.

class SUV extends Car{

   constructor(x,y,b)
 {
    super(x,y)
    this.buyer=b
    
 }
}


Multilevel Inheritance

class Car {
  constructor(n, b) {
    this.name = n;
    this.brand = b;
  }

  showDetails() {
    console.log(`${this.name} ${this.brand}`);
  }
}

class SUV extends Car {
  constructor(x, y) {
    super(x, y);

    this.buyer = 'swanand';
  }
}

class miniSUV extends SUV {
  constructor(x, y) {
    super(x, y);
    this.type = 'mini-suv';
  }
}

//var car1 = new SUV('duster', 'renault');

//console.log(car1);

var car2 = new miniSUV('duster', 'renault');

console.log(car2);


Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class) and then controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the object. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.

OOPs restrict direct access to its methods and variables by encapsulating the code and data together. There are two ways of encapsulation in Javascript:

Class fields are public by default, but private class members can be created by using a hash # prefix. The privacy encapsulation of these class features is enforced by JavaScript itself.

Private instance fields Private instance fields are declared with # names (pronounced "hash names"), which are identifiers prefixed with #. The # is a part of the name itself. Private fields are accessible on the class constructor from inside the class declaration itself. They are used for declaration of field names as well as for accessing a field's value.

It is a syntax error to refer to # names from out of scope. It is also a syntax error to refer to private fields that were not declared before they were called, or to attempt to remove declared fields with delete.

Making data members private using var keyword. Set the data using setter methods and get that data using getter methods. We can manage read and write access of object’s properties by using encapsulation.

Read Only Access : If we declare getter methods only then it facilitates the read only access. Write Only Access : If we declare setter methods only then it facilitates the write only access. Read & Write Access : If we declare both getter and setter methods then it facilitates both read and write access.

Why should Encapsulation to be used ?

Flexibility: It’s more flexible and easy to change the encapsulated code with new set of requirements. For example, if the requirement for adding/removing the project of a employee changes, we can easily update the logic in the setter method () or provided methods.

Reusability: Encapsulated code can be reused throughout the application or across multiple applications.

Maintainability: When application code is encapsulated in separate units (classes, interfaces, methods, getters/setters etc) so it’s easy to change or update a part of the application without affecting other parts, thus reducing the effort and time of the developer.

Testability: For an encapsulated class writing unit tests are easier as the member variables are not scattered all around, thus reducing the time and effort of the tester as well.

Data Hiding: The caller of the methods will have no idea about the internal logic of the class as the member variables are not visible to the caller function. Caller only knows the parameters which are to be passed to the setter method (or any method) for getting initialized with that value. For e.g


  class ClassWithPrivateField {
    #privateField;

    constructor() {
      this.#privateField = 42;
    }
  }

  class SubClass extends ClassWithPrivateField {
    #subPrivateField;

    constructor() {
      super();
      this.#subPrivateField = 23;
    }
  }

  let x = new ClassWithPrivateField();
  console.log('x:', x.privateField);

     
Abstraction
An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

Points to remember We cannot create an instance of Abstract Class. It reduces the duplication of code.

/there is no way to mark a class as abstract in ES6,
//however you can force a class to behave line one by
//	- forcing derived classes to override a method
//	- causing the base class's contructor to throw an error so that it
//			is never used to create instances of the base type*
// *Be careful, as this will cause problems if you do need derived classes
// 	to call super() contructor


class Employee
{
constructor() {
if(this.constructor == Employee){
throw new Error(" Object of Abstract Class cannot be created");
}
}
display(){
throw new Error("Abstract Method has no implementation");
}
}
class Manager extends Employee
{
display(){
//super.display();
console.log("I am a Manager");
}
}
//var emp = new Employee;
var mang=new Manager();
mang.display();

Polymorphism
As JavaScript has a mechanism to support the OOPS paradigm, Polymorphism is one of the basic principles which is supported by it. As object-oriented programming concepts revolve mainly around objects the objects can behave differently in different scenarios. Polymorphism is nothing but one type but many forms. One type of object can behave differently depending upon the runtime scenario. Polymorphism uses the concept of Inheritance to achieve this. In polymorphism, multiple objects will have the same method but different implementation and depending upon the user preference the corresponding object will be selected and the method corresponding to that object will be executed.

class Vehicle {
run() {
console.log( " Vehicle is running " );
}
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
run() {
console.log( " Car is running " );
}
}
class Truck extends Vehicle {
run() {
console.log( " Truck is running " );
}
}
var v1 = new Vehicle();
var v2 = new Car();
var v3 = new Truck();
console.log( v1 );
v1.run();
console.log( v2 );
v2.run();
console.log( v3 );
v3.run();

Here, we have one parent class Vehicle and two child classes Car and Truck. All the classes have method run() with the same name, but depending upon the reference passed the corresponding run() method will be called.
